- better MTA Admins definitions/roles
- have a good MTA schema (virtual domains ready perhaps?) and ACLs for it
- sort out the read-only accounts: use a generic one instead of creating one
  for each service (like nssldap today). Or not. There are other services which
  need read access, like for example Postfix when using LDAP maps.
- always keep in mind the possibility that we may have too many system
  accounts: don't let this get out of control.
- add minssf support for password access?
- come up with an easy way to switch between a profile of anonymous-can-read
  and only-authenticated-users-can-read. Would be nice if we could add the
  anonynous user to a group and then just have the ACLs end in something like "by
  anongroup read by * none".
- provide personal address books for each user (Mandriva bug #22658)
- try to get rid of anonymous access to ou=sudoers. We may need to rebuild sudo
  pointing it to another configuration file to avoid sharing stuff with nss_ldap
  and pam_ldap, since by default it uses /etc/ldap.conf. We can then make this
  other file mode 0600 owned by root:root and voil√†, same behaviour as with the
  regular /etc/sudoers.
- use a global switch in the installation script so that the administrator can
  choose to have anonymous access enabled or not. A slightly different set of
  ACLs would then be used.
- perhaps, instead of using one account/group per service, wouldn't it be
  better to have accounts/groups per role? Like, for example, "Network
  Administrators"?
- heimdal uses only one branch to create its principals. Here we configured
  ou=People, but that is not very nice because service principals (like
  ldap/ldap.example.com@REALM) would also be stored there. When searching for
  principals, heimdal can find them anywhere on the tree, so perhaps we can get
  away with creating another branch for these service principals?
- benchmark to see the impact of all these ACLs!
- add support for autofs maps in LDAP
