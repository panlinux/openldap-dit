openldap-dit is a fork from openldap-mandriva-dit, which is hosted at
http://svn.mandriva.com/svn/packages/corporate/cs4/devel/openldap-mandriva-dit/
and has a wiki page at http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Projects/OpenLDAP_DIT.

I, Andreas Hasenack, am the original author of openldap-mandriva-dit and have
created this fork after I left Mandriva and started working for Canonical
(March 2008). The main reasons for the fork were:
- I wanted to keep working on it, but needed a hosting server/service
- I wanted to make it compatible with more distributions (Ubuntu being one
  of them, of course)
- I am the original author and no one else ever committed to the project

In this fork I removed the "mandriva" name from script names and paths,
but only to make it more distribution agnostic.

I thank Mandriva for letting me work on it while I was their employee. The
original project is their copyright. I hope to submit these changes back to
them.

The license stays the same as with the original distribution from which it
was forked at version 0.18: GPLv2
